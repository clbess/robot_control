# robot_control

This package can be used on ROS to control turtlebot robots :

- You can control the Turtlebot Burger with 2 bump sensors, 1 IR Sensor and a Servo motor SM-10 attached to rotate the Raspberry Pi camera.
- You can control the Turtlebot Waffle with a WidowX arm attached on it. You can also control each joint of this arm. And finally, you will be able to detect an object and take it with the arm thanks to OpenCV and the Raspberry Pi camera.
